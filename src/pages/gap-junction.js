        The presented observations of GJ details after application of the
        freeze-fracture (FF) technique, were a by-product of my research on the
        ultrastructure of myocyte cell membranes, carried out between 1982 and
        1995 in the Electron Microscopy Laboratory of the Department of Medicine
        of the University of Chicago. My results were the subject of a series of
        publications (<i>American Journal of Physiology</i>, 245 (6), H992-H997,
        1983; <i>Biophysical Journal</i>, 47, 2, 2, 506a, 1985;{' '}

        <i>Tissue and Cell</i>, 18 (5), 793-801, 1986;{' '}
        <i>Circulation Research</i>, 73 (1), 135-146, 1993;{' '}
        <i>Journal of Microscopy</i>, 173 (3), 173-81, 1994;{' '}
        <i>Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry</i>, 43 (5), 481-488,
        1995), which are widely cited.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        To better visualize particles in these membranes and to examine them
        quantitatively, I consistently used three-dimensional imaging (by taking
        hundreds of photographs using electron microscope equipped with a
        tilting table) and analyzing such stereopairs. I used the same method
        taking EM pictures of membrane areas with split GJ, while on the
        complementary replicas I found complementary Face E and P, previously
        adjacent to each other before splitting the same Gap Junction (GJ).
      </p>
      <p>
        This manuscript has never been published. My observations and
        conclusions (demonstrating the lack of complementarity of pits and
        particles in the complementary replicas of split cell membranes, carried
        out on the three-dimensional images (stereopairs) of the same areas of
        GJs in Face E and P in the replicas of the same GJ) were the subject of
        crushing criticism, as being inconsistent with the commonly accepted
        basic model of the structure of GJ. This traditional model, in which
        pits are supposed to be scars in Face E after particles visible in Face
        P were pulled out of them in the FF process, is still presented in this
        way in every textbook of Cell Biology.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reporting my results at the 1984 Cell Biology Conference in
        Baltimore (
        <i>
          Are gap junctional pits and particles complementary structures?{' '}
          <b>Biophysical Journal</b>
        </i>
        , 47, 2, 2, 506a, 1985), I was discouraged to publish the full text of
        this controversial article, because I was at risk of losing funding for
        my research. Therefore, I did not send this manuscript for publication,
        although I was (and I still am) convinced that my conclusions refuting
        the old model are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the examination of GJs no one has ever used my original comparative
        method of matching Face E and P pages by superimposing{' '}
        <b>
          <span className="underline">three-dimensional</span> (3D)
        </b>{' '}
        images of the replicas in the complementary P and E areas of the cell
        membrane interior of the same GJ. Usually, only the comparison of "flat"
        individual photos of face E and P was done, usually in different areas –
        not of the same GJ. Therefore, traditional conclusions were drawn that
        particles must always be complementary to pits in GJ. On the contrary,
        my observations of "matching" the details of complementary face E and P
        structures in replicas of membranes coming from the same areas of the
        same GJ led to the only possible interpretation that when
        three-dimensional images of Face E and P of the same Gap Junction were
        superimposed, the pits "fit" into the space between the connexons. This
        obviously contradicted the commonly accepted view that the pits are
        complementary to particles in the connexon, as if the pits were scars in
        Face E from P Face particles drawn from them. According to my
        observations, between the pits there are halves of connexons broken in
        the middle by FF. In the replicas they appear as complementary to the
        sister set of halves visible as particles on the Face P side.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time when I made this observation, I used numerous simple devices
        and techniques available to me for the evaluation of high-resolution
        black and white microphotographs – electron micrographs (see subsection{' '}
        <i>Material and Methods</i>). To confirm the controversial
        complementarity of the structures that I demonstrated, my excellent
        quality photographs would deserve to be processed now with more advanced
        contemporary computer methods. Unfortunately, at present I am not able
        to perform this task myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I consider this topic somewhat important, because it draws
        attention to the possible role of the space between the connexons, where
        in my opinion the pits are located. Despite the extensive literature on
        the connexons themselves, the importance of the space between them is
        underestimated. After all, just there the unknown forces that hold the
        connections together are located. Nevertheless, the conclusions about
        the role and structure of the connexons are usually drawn through the
        use of theoretical models, and not as a result of directly revealing
        their structure. On the other hand, the factors which keep individual
        connectors together in a common assembly, are probably located in the
        spaces between the connections (appearing as pits), and remain
        underestimated.
